<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:18px;"><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="color:#FF8C00;"><span style="font-size:18px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Y</em></span></span><em>ou</em></span> </span>already probably have information overload just looking at all this text so I will try not to bore you with any unnecessary details. Needless to say, when I first started learning Drupal I was looking for a distribution like this where I could learn and get my hands dirty from the inside out, learning by breaking rather than building, by deconstruction as some would call it, as this is usually the process that works best for me as it does with so many other people. However,&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">my existing choices were somewhat limited especially considering that I also wanted to learn Drupal multi-site configuration with my older setup. I knew that Drupal 8 was coming out soon (hopefully?) and really didn't want to spend the bulk of my time learning things that would be obsolete sooner rather than later, but at the time it seemed like I had no choice and so I eventually bit the bullet. On the way, I decided to chronicle my journey and share my experience and effort with the community by donating this free distribution of Drupal called Drupal LNL, (Locked and Loaded), to help those that might come along and find themselves in the same situation I was in not too long ago. Now in no way am I an expert, and I probably won't be for some time, but I do feel this distribution will help those looking for a leg up on getting started on the path to learning Drupal. Of course, no guarantees come with it, but I have done everything in my power to make sure this has remained a quality release. Also, I realize it's not as visually appealing as some may have liked, but again, that was not my immediate&nbsp;goal and web design was not my focus at the time. That being said,&nbsp;I want to thank Drupal.org, where I spent countless hours looking up answers to questions I had, the Drupal community as a whole for their culture of sharing and commitment and the extended Drupal community such as third-party sites, videos, books, etc., that also extended my knowledge. If there's just one favor that I may ask of all who derive some benefit from this distribution, it would be simply to play it forward to benefit someone else as I have benefited.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So, enough of the introduction right?. What sets this Drupal distribution apart from others? Primarily, it's already seems to be one of the simplest multisite distributions using the original Acquia Dev Desktop in the Drupal community to set up. Secondly, it's also the vast amount of features and options you have right from the start. You could theoretically put the site online and set it and forget it after making some minor configuration changes and adjustments particular to your preferences.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of course, these statements must also come with some disclaimers. As I stated before, though <strong>I can make no guarantees regarding this distribution for your particular purposes,</strong> I have done extensive testing using my own system and if you have a similar setup this <strong>should</strong> work. However, you must keep in mind that this was originally devised by me for my own&nbsp;individual&nbsp;learning and testing purposes only and this was the only system I was able to test this on so there is definitely room for error. Also, in no way can I take credit for any of the modules, templates or other original content that have found its way into this distribution, I have simply collected and made these options readily available in one package through the knowledge and the experience I have gained through the process of learning about Drupal 7 as part of the community. As a matter of fact, <strong>it is most likely that any content found in this distribution IS NOT original content by me at all, but most likely by another person, persons or other third-parties</strong>. Again, a special round of thanks goes to all the original owners. <strong>All content as listed remain property of their respective owners.</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span style="background-color:Yellow;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><u><strong><span style="font-size:16px;">THINGS TO DO IMMEDIATELY AFTER DOWNLOADING THIS DISTRIBUTION!!!!!!&nbsp;</span></strong></u></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><strong>DO NOT ASSUME! </strong></span><br />
<strong><span style="font-size:14px;">READ ALL INSTRUCTIONS AND HELP TEXT BEFORE USING! (THIS CANNOT BE OVERSTATED!) </span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size:14px;"><strong>MAKE A COPY OF THE ENTIRE DOWNLOADED DISTRIBUTION ON YOUR LOCAL HARD DRIVE BEFORE USING IT!</strong><span style="font-size:12px;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size:12px;">This will ensure you do not have to download the distribution again should anything go horribly wrong (at over 500 MB uncompressed it is a pretty sizable download).&nbsp;</span><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">​BACKUP A FULL COPY OF THE SITE USING BACKUP AND MIGRATE OPTIONS: [ENTIRE SITE (CODE, FILES &amp; DB)] TO THE [MANUAL BACKUPS DIRECTORY] USING [DEFAULT SETTINGS].&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="font-size:12px;">This will ensure you are using the default settings to backup (less chance of error) and have a full working copy of the site should anything go horribly wrong.&nbsp;</span><br />
<strong><span style="font-size:14px;">CHECK ALL BACKUP AND MIGRATE SETTINGS AND CONFIGURE TO YOUR NEEDS.&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12px;">This will ensure that your site is tailored to your your specific preferences and needs.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14px;"><b>REMOVE THE full_database FOLDER FROM YOUR SITE. </b><span style="font-size:12px;">Files like this that are left on the site make it more vulnerable.&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span style="font-size:14px;">CHANGE DEFAULT USERNAME AND PASSWORD.</span></strong>&nbsp;This is a major step to ensure&nbsp;your site is not entirely&nbsp;vulnerable</span></span></span><br />
<span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><b>FIRST VIEW AND GET TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW THIS DISTRIBUTION&nbsp;IS SETUP.&nbsp;</b></span><span style="font-size: 12px;">That way, when you are finally ready to configure it to your liking and needs, you know what you are doing and won't cause irreparable harm to your installation.</span></span></p>

<p><u><strong><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">My Setup</span></span></strong></u></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Microsoft Windows XP SP3, Media Center Edition, x86<br />
Acquia&nbsp;Dev Desktop 7.31.37 with Apache Web Server v. 2.2.22 and MySQL Database Server v.5.1.66-community</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;"><strong><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Sorry the instructions sem so long,&nbsp;I just wanted to be thorough. If you look at the directions though, you'll clearly&nbsp;see it's really not that complicated at all!</span></strong></span></p>

<h3 style="color: rgb(255, 99, 71);"><span style="font-size:26px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">HOW TO INSTALL:</span></span></h3>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">So, how to install it on your local server? I will assume you have some knowledge/experience building websites, at least enough to use&nbsp;archivers, servers, etc...</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Download</strong> the distribution <strong>Locked_and_Loaded</strong> Installation&nbsp;Package</span></span></li>

	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Start the <strong>Acquia Dev Desktop Control Panel</strong>, start the <strong>Acquia Drupal Stack</strong></span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Go to <strong>More</strong> or <strong>Settings</strong> and select the <strong>Sites</strong> tab</span></span></li>

	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Next, under <strong>Database</strong>, choose <strong>Create new Database</strong>, input your new database name</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Under <strong>Server</strong>, put the name of your site appended by <strong>.localhost</strong>, eg. such that a site name such as&nbsp;<strong>multisite</strong> will look like <strong>multisite.localhost</strong></span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Press <strong>Import</strong> </span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Drupal now begins its' process. Choose&nbsp;the <strong>Locked&nbsp;and&nbsp;Loaded</strong>&nbsp;setup&nbsp;profile. </span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">You may see a <strong>error page</strong>&nbsp;from Drupal&nbsp;that can be ignored by clicking the link at the bottom&nbsp;"<strong>Check the error messages and proceed with the installation".</strong></span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">The <strong>process will now continue</strong>. It will take some time as this profile is fully loaded and serves as the main site.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Once that process is complete, <strong>you will be asked to fill in some user settings</strong>. </span></span><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Follow the instructions given by Drupal to complete the site setup</strong>.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">When the process is completed, you have finished configuring Drupal setup! Click on the&nbsp;<strong>Visit Your New Site</strong> link.&nbsp;This will be your main site.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<h2 style="color:#FF6347;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">FOR MULTISITES</span></strong></span></h2>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">You must have followed the steps above at least once to create the main site that will hold the Multisites. If you have not already done so, then please, do so now. If you have,&nbsp;then:</span></span></strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Again, <span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">go to <strong>More</strong> or <strong>Settings</strong> and select the <strong>Sites</strong> tab</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Click <strong>Import</strong></span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Use the <strong>Browse</strong> button to find the <strong>Locked_and_Loaded</strong> directory, press <strong>ok</strong> once you have found it</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Once the directory has been found, go to the <strong>Subsite</strong> selector dropdown and you should see several choices altogether, but we will only focus on the <strong>siteOne</strong> folder, <strong>siteTwo</strong> folder and the <strong>siteThree</strong> folder. These are the folders we will use to setup your multisites in.&nbsp;<strong>If you would like to create more</strong>, <strong>copy one of the folders before setup</strong> and <strong>give it an unique name</strong>.&nbsp;For now, simply choose <strong>siteOne.</strong></span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Again, under <strong>Database</strong>, choose <strong>Create New Database</strong>, input the new database name, it will NOT be connected to the previous installations database!</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Under <strong>Server</strong>, it should now have the name of your previously installed site. Underneath this, in the <strong>Subdomain</strong> section, give this new site a name. Now the&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Server section should automatically be updated with the new name such that if you name this new site </span><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>siteOne</strong></span></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">, you will now see <strong>siteone.multisite.localhost</strong> in the Server section</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Press <strong>Import</strong> and <strong>follow the instructions given by Drupal</strong> to complete the site setup</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">When the process is completed, you have finished configuring Drupal setup and this installation will get its configuration options from the main site you previously installed, however, the databases are separate. <strong>You have just completed your first multisite setup!</strong></span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>NOW, REPEAT THE&nbsp;STEPS UNDER 'FOR MULTISITES'&nbsp;TO INSTALL THE OTHER&nbsp;MULTISITES&nbsp;</strong></span></span></li>
	<li><strong><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">ENJOY!</span></span></strong></li>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">If you would like to use the&nbsp;full&nbsp;setup that I've prepared especially for this distribution,&nbsp;<strong>go to the&nbsp;Locked_and_Loaded root folder</strong>. There you will <strong>find a&nbsp;folder named&nbsp;full_database</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Inside this folder you will <strong>find an&nbsp;SQL&nbsp;and a&nbsp;zipped&nbsp;version of the same database</strong>, <strong>choose one to import&nbsp;into your current database</strong>.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Import into the database</strong> by <strong>using the&nbsp;Acquia&nbsp;Dev Desktop&nbsp;Control Panel</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>clicking on the&nbsp;Manage my database&nbsp;button</strong> link.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Once there,&nbsp;<strong>find and click your&nbsp;current database name</strong>. Click on the&nbsp;<strong>Import tab</strong>&nbsp;and next to the&nbsp;<strong>Browse your computer section</strong>,&nbsp;use the&nbsp;<strong>Choose File</strong>&nbsp;button to&nbsp;<strong>navigate to the full_database folder</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>choose the&nbsp;SQL&nbsp;or&nbsp;zipped file</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Press Go</strong>.&nbsp;After this process is complete, you should <strong>see a success message</strong> stating the <strong>database was imported properly</strong></span></span></li>
